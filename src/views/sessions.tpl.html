            What Can DevOps and Remote Work learn from each other?

            More people than ever are working from home. Estimates range from
            10% (in the least remote-work-friendly countries) to 60% in the United States.
            Even global data shows that half of all workers may be remote by 2020.
            DevOps, the cultural movement towards more agile systems administration,
            has also been gaining traction. Gartner estimates that 25% of global 2000
            businesses will employ DevOps as a mainstream strategy by 2016.
